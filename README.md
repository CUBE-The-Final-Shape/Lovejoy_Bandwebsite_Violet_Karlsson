# Lovejoy Bandwebsite, By: Violet Karlsson

For our final assignment in webserver development we were tasked to create a website for an existing artist or band. I chose Lovejoy. This github repository contains the files I made during the project.

# The site supports:
+ XML storage of concert info
+ Database driven login
+ "Ordering system" using a database (Can't send emails)
+ Account registration
+ Account page
+ Cancel orders if ordered while logged in

# To be added
+ Account deletion
